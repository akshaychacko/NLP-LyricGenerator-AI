# NLP-LyricGenerator-AI
A python based country music lyric generator that uses Natural Language Processing.
Utilizes an expansive library of existing country music lyrics to generate new ones.

Splits pre-existing lyrics into unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, and utilizes user-defined grammatical rules on how these should go together to form sentences of new lyrics. Also utilizes these grammatical rules to form the structure of a country song (ie. verse, chorus, bridge).

Main code is found in generate.py
